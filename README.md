## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, MongoDB

My goal in creating this app was to gain a better understanding of the server-database relationship, with a particular emphasis on using Express to create a 'get' request and display the data in the DOM.

## Lessons Learned:

Ensure database connection string and node_modules files are added to the  .gitignore file to protect the database and minimize the file size.

## Examples:
Take a look at a couple of these examples that I have in my own portfolio:
